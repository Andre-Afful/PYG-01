# PYG-01
A Time Tracking Program

INTRODUCTION
Nana is a business man who has a consultancy firm. As a result, he charges a fixed rate per hour for every task that he carries out for his clients. Nana has realised that to make his work easier, he needs a program that will enable him to enter the time at which he started and ended a task, and with that information calculate the amount of money he earns within that period. A program was designed by the Azubi PYG-01 team that would enable Nana to achieve this.
